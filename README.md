# Overview
For many university students, submitting homework in latex is a requirement. Latexing homeworks takes a long time, and it is often hard to find and remmeber the right symbols and combinations of symbols when writing an expression. This library will output latex code given an image of a handwritten mathematical expression. It will focus on a subset of expressions.
